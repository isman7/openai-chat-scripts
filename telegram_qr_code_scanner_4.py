## Telegram QR Code scanner 4

This script was generated playing with https://chat.openai.com/chat, and it might not be functional, but it seems to me it is.

### Prompts: 

- Hi! I have this code which scans an image looking for QR Codes using a Google API, could we use an Azure API instead to do the same task? Thanks. (pasted the code in https://github.com/isman7/openai-chat-scripts/blob/master/telegram_qr_code_scanner_2.py)
- Could you please do not break the example and give it altogether? Thanks.
