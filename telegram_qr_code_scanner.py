## Telegram QR Code scanner

This script was generated playing with https://chat.openai.com/chat, and it might not be functional, but it seems to me it is.

### Prompts: 

- Hi there! I would like to create a Telegram Bot written in Python with telebot that reads QR Codes from images from the user. Could you provide and example?
- I thinks your example is wrong, as the library qrcode is for creating QR Codes instead of reading them, I suggest we use the library "pyzbar" to read the codes, instead. 
- That is really nice, but we shoudn't be ignoring the user, let us return the user the data from the pyzbar.decode function, which is a list, so I suggest we return it as several telegram messages.
- I've detected a small mistake the import from pyzbar should be "from pyzbar import pyzbar" if not the decode function wont work!

        # Get the largest version of the image

        # Read the QR code(s) in the image
        qr_codes = pyzbar.decode(image)

        # Send the decoded QR code(s) to the user as multiple messages
        for qr_code in qr_codes:
            bot.send_message(message.chat.id, qr_code.data.decode('utf-8'))

bot.polling()
